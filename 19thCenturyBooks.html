        <h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
        <p>Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most 
            popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her o
            wn darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creat
            ure as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth 
            and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And 
            Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of 
            flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.</p>

Should she stay with Rochester and live with the consequences, or follow her convictions - even if it means leaving the man she loves?

        <h3>Les Misérables</h3>
        <p>Victor Hugo's tale of injustice, heroism and love follows the fortunes of Jean Valjean, an escaped convict determined to put his criminal past behind him. But his attempts to become a respected member of the community are constantly put under threat: by his own conscience, when, owing to a case of mistaken identity, another man is arrested in his place; and by the relentless investigations of the dogged Inspector Javert. It is not simply for himself that Valjean must stay free, however, for he has sworn to protect the baby daughter of Fantine, driven to prostitution by poverty.</p>

        <h3>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h3>
        <p>In this celebrated work Wilde forged a devastating portrait of the effects of evil and debauchery on a young aesthete in late-19th-century England. Combining elements of the Gothic horror novel and decadent French fiction, the book centers on a striking premise: As Dorian Gray sinks into a life of crime and gross sensuality, his body retains perfect youth and vigor while his recently painted portrait grows day by day into a hideous record of evil, which he must keep hidden from the world. For over a century, this mesmerizing tale of horror and suspense has enjoyed wide popularity. It ranks as one of Wilde's most important creations and among the classic achievements of its kind.</p>

        <h3>Wuthering Heights</h3>
        <p>At the centre of this novel is the passionate love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff - recounted with such emotional intensity that a plain tale of the Yorkshire moors acquires the depth and simplicity of ancient tragedy.

            This best-selling Norton Critical Edition is based on the 1847 first edition of the novel. For the Fourth Edition, the editor has collated the 1847 text with several modern editions and has corrected a number of variants, including accidentals. The text is accompanied by entirely new explanatory annotations.</p>
